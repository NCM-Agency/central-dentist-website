  "introduction": "As we've recently expanded our practice and brought in new technology and equipment (such as our CBCT machine, ozone therapy, and SMART equipment), we thought this would be a great opportunity to update our office to reflect who we are to those new to our practice and to remind our existing patients why they've chosen to partner with us for their families' care.\n\nWhat we hope you feel when you step into our office is that we are committed to a positive (dare we say, fun!) experience for adults and children alike. We recognize that each family and each individual patient will have a unique dental history and personal goals for their future oral and systemic health. We want to personalize and optimize each person's visit with us, allowing you to feel at ease with our consultations and our treatment appointments.",
