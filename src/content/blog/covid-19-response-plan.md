Dear Central Dentist Family,

In the last several days, attention to the COVID-19 infection has increased. We understand that our patients may be concerned about coming in for their appointments. However, continued follow up care is needed to ensure you remain healthy.  Central Dentist has always maintained a comprehensive infection control process, and we regularly sanitize our office to prevent the spread of infection; this includes an advanced air purification system that turns over the air every 30 minutes to maintain the same air quality as in a hospital operating room.

Fortunately, our office has already been operating at the most advanced levels to protect our patients and our staff from airborne toxins and pathogens in our commitment to safe handling of mercury; so our office and team are well prepared to safeguard against any other airborne concern. But as related to COVID-19, we are taking extra precautions to account for spread of disease in additional ways to protect you during your visit.


## In-Office Protocols:

- We are asking patients to complete a screening questionnaire before they arrive to their appointment.  We are rescheduling appointments if the screen reveals a significant risk of infection or infection exposure.
- All patients will be quickly taken to the exam room or private waiting room to help meet the CDCs recommendations for social distancing.
- We are asking for no more than one person accompanying a patient to their appointment.  That person will be subject to the same screening for infection risk as the patient.
- Should anyone arrive with symptoms suggesting COVID-19 infection as identified by the CDC, they will not be admitted to our office and will be asked to reschedule when they have recovered.
- We are working with our building management to help prevent contamination within our local community.
- We continue to utilize Surgically Clean Air Units, which purifies air within the office every 30 minutes through a 6 stage filtration and sterilization process that removes particles including odors, gases, mold, allergens and viruses. (Please contact me at jro@centraldentist.com if you are interested in purchasing these units for your home during this time.)

- We are working to expand our telehealth capability and are able to address preliminary issues via tele-dental methods.
- We have increased our vigilance and frequency of wiping down our office using CDC recommended disinfectants. We are utilizing ozone water to sterilize and keep all areas of the office clean.  Ozone is the most powerful and rapidly-acting oxidizing agent on earth. One molecule of ozone is equal in its activity to between 3,000 to 10,000 molecules of chlorine. It is the best killer of harmful, pathogenic organisms, including viruses.
- Our team members are being vigilant about their own health and will stay home if ill or have been exposed to COVID-19 and will contact their primary care physician to determine if they are safe to return to work. None of our staff is showing symptoms of COVID-19; no staff has traveled to high risk countries over the past weeks. However, we are self-monitoring our temperature and overall health routinely.


## We are asking the following of our patients:

- If you or anyone in your household or recent contacts has respiratory symptoms or a fever, please do not come into the office. Please call to reschedule.
- If you have traveled in the past two weeks to a foreign country, please do not come into the office. Please call to reschedule.
- We are asking patients to restrict themselves to one accompanying caregiver. We are happy to include additional family or friends you want involved with your care through FaceTime or phone call during your visit.
- We are encouraging patients to make use of our hand washing facilities and have hand sanitizer in each room.

It is important to us that you are comfortable with your continued care through our practice. We will do everything we can to keep you and your family safe. 

Please stay safe and healthy during this pandemic.  Practice frequent hand washings and cover your nose and mouth with a tissue if coughing.  Avoid touching your face.  If you have traveled to countries designated as Level 3 Health Notice country by the CDC, please stay home for at least 14 days from the time you left the area and self-monitor. 

Many area hospitals have designated special rooms and entries for patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection.  If you are short of breath and have symptoms severe enough to warrant seeking emergency care, please call the ER in advance to alert them you are coming.

On behalf of our doctors and team, we are here for you. We continue to monitor the situation and will make changes to our procedures as more information becomes available. We will pull together as a community and halt this pandemic by taking the proper precautions.  Please feel free to call the office if you have any questions about anything. We are also happy to help deliver items to seniors or immunocompromised patients who are unable to get out. We are in this together.

Sincerely,

Dr Jill Ombrello
