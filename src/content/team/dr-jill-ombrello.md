philosophy: "I believe that achieving a healthy smile is within the capacity of every person and is as much dependent on their understanding of their oral health as on the protocols and standards of care that are actually delivered. Dentistry should serve as a foundation for optimal health—not merely fixing what's broken, but preventing disease and supporting total body wellness."
