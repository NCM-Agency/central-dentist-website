    content: "Abstract: The oral cavity appears as an open ecosystem, with a dynamic balance between the entrance of microorganisms, colonization modalities, and host defenses aimed to their removal: To avoid elimination, bacteria need to adhere to either hard dental surfaces or epithelial surfaces. The oral biofilm formation and development, and the inside selection of specific microorganisms have been correlated with the most common oral pathologies, such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and peri-implantitis. The mechanical removal of the biofilm and adjunctive use of antibiotic disinfectants or various antibiotics have been the conventional methods for periodontal therapy. Ozone (O3) is a triatomic molecule, consisting of three oxygen atoms, and its application in medicine and dentistry has been indicated for the treatment of 260 different pathologies. The ozone therapy has been more beneficial than present conventional therapeutic modalities that follow a minimally invasive and conservative application to dental treatment. The exposition of molecular mechanisms of ozone further benefits practical function in dentistry."

    title: "Calcium Oxide as a Root Filling Material: a Three-Year Prospective Clinical Outcome Study",
    date: "March 1, 2011",
    source: "NCBI",
    sourceUrl: null,
    content: "Abstract: Calcium oxide, available for decades as a root canal filling material, has been little used in recent years due to its lack of radio-opacity, and an expectation that it would lead to an excess of root fractures. In this study, four general dentists submitted 79 cases of endodontically treated teeth whose roots were filled with either Biocalex 6/9, or Endocal-10, and rendered adequately radio-opaque with yttrium oxide. 57 teeth were available for follow up at three years. Criteria for success were comfort, function, radiographic signs of healing. The overall success rate was 89%. The percentage of teeth retained in function was 98%; aside from one equivocal case, no teeth were lost to root fractures. These numbers are indistinguishable from success rates reported for conventional root filling materials. Conclusion: Calcium oxide may be considered a safe and viable alternative to other current methods of root obturation."

He explains, \"Toxic dental materials have created much havoc in the dental profession, as well as in patient health, for nearly two centuries. Dental mercury fillings, nickel crowns (especially in children, called \"chrome crowns\"), root canals and cavitations have been the target of concern for a long time.\""

      Biological root canal therapy represents a paradigm shift in endodontic treatment, focusing on biocompatibility,
      tissue regeneration, and the elimination of chronic infections without compromising the body's natural healing processes.
