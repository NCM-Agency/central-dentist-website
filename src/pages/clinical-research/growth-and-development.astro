    source: "CNN",
    sourceUrl: "https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/health/tonsils-removed-surgery-children-study/index.html",
    content: "Summary: After reviewing the studies, the researchers found that, even in children with a few infections, their throat infections, health care utilization and school absences improved in the first year after surgery versus those who did not undergo surgery. However, benefits did not persist over time, and longer-term outcomes were limited, the researchers wrote. The researchers noted that they advocate for parents and physicians to make the decision together regarding a possible tonsillectomy for a child. The surgery poses risks, such as the potential for serious bleeding, swelling, infection, or reactions to anesthetics, that must be weighed with the potential benefits."

Looking at your toothless wonder, it may be hard to imagine a life full of dental visits, orthodontia, and maybe even oral surgery (because wisdom teeth rarely behave themselves and often need to be removed) but they are all a reality and may come sooner than you might think."
