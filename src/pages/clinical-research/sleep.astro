    content: "Summary: Three studies by researchers at Wheaton College in Illinois found significant connections between breathing disorders that interrupt sleep and the accumulation of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. People with sleep-disordered breathing experience repeated episodes of hypopnea (under-breathing) and apnea (not breathing) during sleep. It occurs when the upper airway closes fully or partially while efforts to breathe continue, and it can wake a person 50 or 60 times a night, interrupting the stages of sleep necessary for a restful night."

    content: "Summary: Young children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are more likely to develop behavioral problems including hyperactivity and aggressiveness, as well as emotional and friendship difficulties, according to researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. The study, the largest and most comprehensive of its kind, evaluated and followed more than 11,000 children for over six years. \"This is the strongest evidence to date that snoring, mouth breathing, and apnea (abnormally long pauses in breathing during sleep) can have serious behavioral and social - emotional consequences for children,\" said study leader Karen Bonuck, Ph.D., professor of family and social medicine and of obstetrics and gynecology and women's health at Einstein. \"Parents and pediatricians alike should be paying closer attention to sleep - disordered breathing in young children, perhaps as early as the first year of life\""

We hypothesized that, in children with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome without prolonged oxyhemoglobin desaturation, early adenotonsillectomy, as compared with watchful waiting with supportive care, would result in improved outcomes."

Data from 29 studies conducted in 16 countries suggest that short sleep is associated with an increased risk for being or becoming overweight/obese or having increased body fat. Late bedtimes were also found to be a risk factor for overweight/obesity. Findings also suggest that changes in eating pathways may lead to increased body fat. Future experimental studies are needed to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which sleep may play a role in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity."

Conclusions: The prevalence estimate of 45% for mild sleep disturbances in the TD cohort highlights pediatric sleep debt as a public health problem of concern. The prevalence estimate of 66% for moderate sleep disturbances in the ASD cohort underscores the significant sleep problems that the families of these children face. The predominant sleep disorders in the ASD cohort were behavioral insomnia sleep-onset type and insomnia due to PDD."

      The Critical Importance of Quality Sleep
    </h2>
    <p class="text-body-large mb-8">
      Sleep-disordered breathing is far more than just snoring—it's a serious health condition that affects
      cognitive development, behavior, learning, and long-term health outcomes. Extensive research demonstrates
      that proper breathing and quality sleep are essential for optimal brain function, emotional regulation,
      and overall wellness at every age.

        Critical Finding: The largest study of its kind, following over 11,000 children for six years,
        found that sleep-disordered breathing is strongly associated with behavioral problems, hyperactivity,
