              Does your child's snoring sound like a freight train? Are you concerned that a recent diagnosis
              of ADD or ADHD may be inaccurate, or that his or her thumb sucking will cause permanent issues?
              Is your child troubled by bed wetting, overly tired in the morning, challenged in school or has
              allergies? All of these could be signs your child has Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB).
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-regular text-gray-medium">
              Sleep Disordered Breathing is an all-inclusive term for breathing difficulties, ranging from
              quiet snoring to severe airway obstruction during sleep. When your child's breathing is disrupted,
              his or her body recognizes the disruption as choking, therefore, slowing the heart rate, raising
              the blood pressure, arousing the brain, and disrupting sleep, which impacts your child's dental
              and overall health.

              Healthy Start is just as its name suggests; is a start-up system to help your child's teeth
              come in properly. Its use provides no discomfort, and it is a natural way to guide your child's
              teeth to proper alignment. The Healthy Start System™ is a revolutionary departure from traditional
              orthodontics into an early, non-invasive, natural way of straightening teeth. It works as well as
              or better than braces, plastic aligners, surgery, or any other option to achieve a picture-perfect,
              beautiful smile.

            <p class="text-body-regular text-gray-medium">
              For patients between the ages of 4 and 7, the Healthy Start System works with the natural forces
              of tooth eruption. The soft, comfy, removable device tenderly guides the erupting teeth into their
              perfect positions. In addition, Healthy Start aids in the correct growth and alignment of the lower
              jaw while tending to facial aesthetics, as well.
