              Based on a wide variety of credible, <a href="/clinical-research" class="text-header-secondary hover:underline">peer-reviewed research</a>,
              we understand that the root cause of many chronic inflammatory symptoms is associated with a compromised
              airway, which can cause disturbances to breathing both during the day and at night while a patient is
              sleeping. While the presentation of these symptoms may be different in adults vs. children, our
              philosophical basis of therapy is similar in that we employ minimally invasive medical & dental devices,
              myofunctional exercises, and lifestyle changes to address the root cause. By treating this root cause,
              we can eliminate the need for pharmaceutical intervention (ie. prescription medications) that is limited
              in benefit to masking symptoms of this inflammation without ever "healing" the true etiology.

              Sleep-disordered breathing is an umbrella term for several chronic conditions in which partial or
              complete cessation of breathing occurs many times throughout the night, resulting in daytime sleepiness
              or fatigue that interferes with a person's ability to function and reduces quality of life. SDB causes
              systemic inflammation and can manifest itself in a variety of symptoms that can be easily overlooked,
              misdiagnosed, and most unfortunately, left untreated.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-regular text-gray-medium">
              Awareness related to sleep-disordered breathing in both adults and children has increased drastically
              over the past two decades. Traditionally seen in the field of sleep medicine, most patients diagnosed
              with "sleep issues" fit the stereotype of an older person, oftentimes overweight, who snores loudly.
              However, in more recent years, physicians, dentists, and research scientists have tested and proven
              that sleep and airway disturbances occur much more commonly, and the presentation of associated
              symptoms looks very different based on the patient type.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-regular text-gray-medium">
              For example in a child, audible breathing at nighttime is indicative of an airway issue that would
              disturb sleep; if a child is actually snoring, then he or she has a further progression of the disorder,
              or is presenting with more severe symptoms. Additionally, "young fit females" has become a classification
              for high risk patients who's symptoms are not only different to identify from what is typically associated
              with this disorder, but oftentimes these patients get misdiagnosed or their symptoms are "excused away"
              based on lifestyle or other factors.
