    question: 'How long does dental bonding last?',
    answer: 'With proper care, dental bonding can last 5-10 years or longer. The longevity depends on your oral hygiene habits, the location of the bonding, and lifestyle factors.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the bonding procedure painful?',
    answer: 'No, dental bonding is typically painless and often requires no anesthesia unless it\'s being used to fill a cavity. The procedure is non-invasive and comfortable.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can bonding be used on any tooth?',
    answer: 'Bonding works best on front teeth and areas with less biting pressure. For molars or areas with heavy wear, we may recommend stronger alternatives like ceramic restorations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I care for bonded teeth?',
    answer: 'Care for bonded teeth just like natural teeth with regular brushing and flossing. Avoid biting hard objects and limit staining foods and drinks for the first 48 hours after treatment.'
  }

      Dental bonding is a conservative treatment option for repairing chipped, cracked, or discolored teeth.
      At Central Dentist, we exclusively use <strong class="text-teal">fluoride-free bonding materials</strong>
      that are biocompatible and safe for your overall health. Our composite bonding materials bond naturally
      to your tooth structure and can be color-matched to blend seamlessly with your natural teeth.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-dark leading-relaxed">
      For patients who come to our practice with existing fluoridated bonding, we offer to replace these
      materials with our safer, fluoride-free alternatives. This holistic approach ensures that all materials
      in your mouth support your overall wellness while providing excellent aesthetic and functional results
      that can last for many years with proper care.
