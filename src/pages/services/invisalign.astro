        <!-- Dr. Beth's Philosophy -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            While our team of doctors has advanced training in comprehensive orthodontics from the United States Dental Institute, we have found Invisalign to be the greatest tool to achieve the best clinical outcomes in the swiftest manner possible for the vast majority of our adult patients. We also appreciate the hundreds of millions of dollars that AlignTech (parent company to Invisalign & iTero) has invested in research, development, and training over its history to stay on the frontier of orthodontics and oral health as a whole; whereas the process of traditional dental braces is still very much the same as it was when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces#History" target="_blank" class="text-teal hover:text-teal-dark underline">originally developed 18th century</a>. Sure, there has been some metal material improvement here and there, but otherwise, we think using braces over Invisalign is comparable to choosing a horse and buggy over a Tesla as a primary means of transportation (not that new, ridiculous space truck that recently went viral, but you know what we mean). It's a no brainer. (disclaimer: there are definitely some isolated, severe orthognathic cases that may require this traditional/metal approach, but those are very, very rare, so we're focused on the majority).

        <!-- Technology Explanation -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            These clear aligners are invisible and removable, which means they can be seamlessly incorporated into your life without disrupting your professional career or your oral health routine. They are much more comfortable & contribute to far less inflammation in the body than any metal-based technique.
          </p>
          
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Oh, not to mention they use machine learning and algorithm-based technology (ie. artificial intelligence) to enhance each case. If you're unfamiliar with what this type of engineering facilities, it essentially means they have an extraordinarily huge database that they use to understand and learn how to do something in the best way possible. And this data is collected from all over the world and can contribute to the advancement of new results in real time. Here's another fun, educational analogy for you since I understand that machine learning can be a little challenging to comprehend if you're new to the concept... If you needed a very serious, difficult surgical procedure, would you rather go to a surgeon who has done this procedure 15,000 times, or a surgeon who has done it 7.5 million times?! You obviously would want to go to the surgeon with the most amount of experience because she has more knowledge about every single part of the process. So who's who in this analogy? The surgeon with less experience represents a single dentist who uses traditional braces in his practice and leverages what he's learned from his cases and maybe those he's read about in journals and was exposed to at professional conferences (I estimated 2 cases per day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year, over an estimated 30 year career). The surgeon with the 7.5 million times is a dentist who uses Invisalign, because she has access to the collective wisdom of all patients ever treated by this technology, and the aligners are created with this wisdom at its core. And if you find this interesting, I highly recommend you watch Netflix's AlphaGo to learn more; it has nothing to do with dentistry, but it's just a really cool documentary about present-day and future implications of machine learning.
          </p>
          
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Ok. That was a heck of a tangent. But let's get back on track...
          </p>

        <!-- Provider Selection -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            If that isn't exciting enough, you may be wondering who to choose as your Invisalign provider. It seems as if there is one on every corner, like a Starbucks, right? Well, I believe this is an appropriate place for me (Dr. Beth) to step in to brag about <a href="/team/jill-ombrello-dds" class="text-teal hover:text-teal-dark underline">my partner, my sister, & my bestie Dr. Jill,</a> because she's far too humble & low key to publish something like this about herself. Fortunately, I have no problem boasting about her hard work & accomplishments. And I think patients can benefit most from authentic candor & just getting to the meat of the convo, without some overly careful, diplomatic, or obscure verbiage. If you <em>are</em> offended by my approach to this discussion, then you're probably not the right fit for our practice anyway, so thank u. next. But I do wish you well :) .
          </p>
          
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            And for those who can appreciate a healthcare provider who communicates to you like a real human being, then let's get to it...
          </p>
          
          <p class="font-body text-gray-medium mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            First & foremost, whether you are in the Dallas Ft Worth area or anywhere else in the world, I would suggest you only partner with a provider who is a member of the <a href="https://www.aacaligners.com" target="_blank" class="text-teal hover:text-teal-dark underline">American Academy of Clear Aligners</a> (AACA), which Dr. Jill has been for awhile, and I hope to be sooner rather than later. Membership in this academy means a few things:
          </p>
          
          <ul class="font-body text-gray-medium space-y-4 mb-8">
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-teal mr-2">•</span>
              These doctors have had advanced training (let's call it, "continuing education on steroids") in Invisalign Technology & case management which allows providers to deliver the best clinical results on the fastest timelines possible. For the majority of our patients, Dr. Jill is able to achieve optimal outcomes in as little as 4 months.
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-teal mr-2">•</span>
              The members of this academy are in constant communication every single day to collaborate, share, & optimize; so while you are definitely choosing one, main doctor as your provider, you as a patient have the benefit of leveraging the collective expertise of this enormous group of providers on top of the collective wisdom of the Invisalign database. ( ::insert mind blown emoji:: )
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-teal mr-2">•</span>
              I've met some of these AACA doctors, and they are literally the most fun, coolest people. It's almost like they're not even dentists ;) So considering you're gonna be seeing these docs a lot during the course of your treatment, wouldn't you rather work with someone who is actually fun to hang out with? Oh! I see another opportunity for an unnecessary, educational analogy!!

            Ideally at this point, you're convinced of the value of Invisalign and of receiving care from an AACA doctor. Now I need to add the cherry on top when I tell you why Dr. Jill specifically is the best of the best. Beyond her training with USDI and AACA, she also has expertise beyond this which includes:

              <span class="text-teal mr-2">•</span>

              <span class="text-teal mr-2">•</span>
              Her undergraduate degree was in physical therapy, so she has a deeper understanding of how malocclusion (or crooked teeth) can effect your posture and body as a whole; she has a broader skillset to address painful muscle imbalances & dysfunction in the neck, shoulder, and upper back that occur when your jaws have been out of alignment

              <span class="text-teal mr-2">•</span>
              She's reinvested a tremendous amount back into our practice to expand our <a href="/services/advanced-diagnostics" class="text-teal hover:text-teal-dark underline">diagnostic tools</a>, technology, and training to make sure we are delivering the highest quality of care possible to our patients.
