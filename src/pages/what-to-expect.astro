              Greetings, new friend! If you're reading this, then that most likely means that you are considering our doctors and our practice as your new provider. We thank you for the opportunity to introduce ourselves. We have provided answers to what we believe to be some important questions, and you can learn more about our doctors <a href="/our-history" style="color: #0099ba;">here</a>. But feel free to reach out to anyone on our team via the contact information listed below to inquire further.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-section-header text-header-primary mt-8 mb-4">First things first, what's our "why"?</h3>

            <p class="text-body-regular mb-6">
              It's important that you, a potential patient, know that we choose to view our primary role as "doctor" means for us to serve as an educator. We recognize that you come to us because we have the advanced education, training, experience, and knowledge of ongoing research to help inform and guide you on your path to restoring and/or maintaining optimal oral and systemic health. We are also aware of the present-day burden on patients to sift through all of the information from other doctors, online, and from friends and family. Beyond that, we know that typically once a patient has started to seek out alternative therapies (such as ours), you've already spent a great deal of time and money on the wrong approaches to your health or "solutions" to your ailments. As such, we would like to make this first step as easy as possible for you so you can more swiftly work towards better understanding your oral health and its relation to your systemic wellness.

              The first visit will be with a dental hygienist to collect all of your diagnostic records (listed below), review your medical history, and discuss your overall health goals. This first appointment takes about 90 minutes and may or may not include a hygiene visit. The doctor will make time to review the information with you immediately after that and potentially suggest some further testing. Since we are doing such a deep review of all of your historic and present-day health history and concerns, and there is so much to evaluate between the oral-systemic health link, we sometimes request a second appointment to review the treatment plan with the doctor. However, if having two separate visits is not your preference, we will gladly accommodate you and do our best to make that same-day review as comprehensive as possible.
